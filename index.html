<br>I'm a PhD student in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at University of Houston, my research explores the intersection of **_material science_**, **_structural mechanics_**, and **_advanced computational modeling_**. While my current focus lies in understanding and optimizing the mechanical behavior of soft materials, I am passionate about leveraging these skills to tackle broader engineering challenges. My expertise in experimental techniques, multiscale modeling, and data analysis equips me to contribute to diverse fields such as robotics, biomedical devices, sustainable materials, and advanced manufacturing.

Looking ahead, I aim to expand my research to integrate emerging technologies like machine learning and multiscale simulation frameworks. These tools will enable me to address complex, multidisciplinary problemsâ€”from designing adaptable structures for energy-efficient systems to developing **_novel materials for healthcare and environmental applications_**. My goal is to contribute to innovations that not only solve technical challenges but also promote sustainability and improve quality of life.
