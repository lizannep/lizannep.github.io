# Next steps

Congratulations on making it this far! You now have all the tools to easily build a beautiful website for free. 

- After you get comfortable with the basics of writing in markdown, I suggest taking a look at this [sample post](https://beautifuljekyll.com/2020-02-28-sample-markdown/) and [the code that created it](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll/master/_posts/2020-02-28-sample-markdown.md) to learn some more advanced tips about markdown.

- I **highly recommend** going over the [*Frequently Asked Questions*](https://beautifuljekyll.com/faq/) to find out answers to questions you may not even know you have. Every few months I suggest checking the [*What's New?*](https://beautifuljekyll.com/updates/) page to see if there are new features, and learn [how to update your site to the newest version](https://beautifuljekyll.com/faq/#updating) when it's time.

- You can also check out the [advanced installation methods](https://beautifuljekyll.com/getstarted/#install-steps-hard) that give you a little more control but are harder to use. Keep in mind that Beautiful Jekyll was primarily designed to be used as a GitHub theme, so you will not get any support if you choose one of the Ruby installation methods. 

- Remember that Beautiful Jekyll is built on top of Jekyll. This means that reading through the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/) will introduce you to many more features that you might find useful!

Beautiful Jekyll is used by 50,000+ people with wildly varying degrees of web skills, so it's impossible to answer all the questions that may arise. For any question that's not specifically related to Beautiful Jekyll and is more about Jekyll or web development in general, the answer can often be found on Google, in the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/), or on the [Jekyll support forum](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/).
